    <h2>Community Work</h2>
    <p>My campaign is grounded in the lived experience of working with and for the community. Here are a few of the initiatives I've led or been deeply involved in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fundraising for the NDP National Convention:</strong> Organized a successful concert fundraiser to help bring diverse voices to the national stage.</li>
      <li><strong>Tenant-Led Response Initiatives:</strong> Coordinated community-led strategies for overdose response and housing advocacy in nonprofit and student housing sectors.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Engagement Research:</strong> Developed toolkits to support NDP riding associations in recruiting and retaining volunteers, improving local participation in democratic processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Graduate Student Leadership:</strong> Served as VP of the McMaster Graduate Student Association, advocating for better services, mental health supports, and fair funding for students.</li>
      <li><strong>Grassroots Campaigning:</strong> Worked on civic engagement projects across Hamilton focused on climate, justice, and equitable development.</li>
    </ul>
